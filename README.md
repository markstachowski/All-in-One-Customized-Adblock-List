# All-in-One-Customized-Adblock-List

A comprehensive, all-in-one adblock list for thorough blocking of trackers, popup ads, ads, 
unwanted cookies, fake news, cookie warning messages, unwanted comment sections,
crypto-coin mining, YouTube clutter and social network hassles.

(VITAL:)
Be sure to disable any lists that appear in the list below that you already have active in
the settings/dashboard. e.g. https://i.imgur.com/ZIUPnhD.png

Tested in uBlock Origin for Google Chrome, Firefox and Edge; it should work just
fine in any decent adblocker that supports Adblock Plus 2.0 formatted lists.
    
It includes customized entries that block particularly annoying page elements.
It is actively maintained (updates daily), has no duplicates, is sorted alphabetically
and is saved in UTF-8 format. Have fun :D

Usage:
In your adblocker's filter lists section add the URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hl2guide/All-in-One-Customized-Adblock-List/master/deanoman-adblocklist.txt
